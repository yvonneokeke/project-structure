    <!-- This is a section that you would want to wrap in a header tag.
         I notice HTML5 structural elements (nav, section) are also
         missing.

         The way you added your address is fine. You could have also
         used line breaks and/or an address tag.

         You can use an 'a' tag to create a link for your email 
         address which would allow someone to click on it and send you 
         an email. You should still look into how one does that, but 
         that method is a way spammers harvest email addresses, so... 
         instead, try using http://hivelogic.com/enkoder/ to include a 
         link to your email address.

      <!-- The main thing missing here is the nav tag. Remember to
           wrap your navigation in it.

           This works fine, but remember, it is generally best to use
           lowercase lettering. If you opt to change this, make sure
           you change the id values below, too.

      <!-- This would be an example of a section. 

           Very nice job formatting your information here. Perhaps
           use strong emphasis or emphasis for major and minor?

           Also, nice job adding related course work under a lower
           header. This is a perfect example of creating hierarchy
           through use of headers in a section.

      <!-- Something else worth noting in terms of HTML5 structure: 
           for each job within this section, you could further wrap it 
           with an article tag.

           There is lots of strong emphasis here. Maybe you only want
           to use it to highlight your job role? The location, dates
           are smaller details.

           Very nice job to include links to the groups you are 
           working with. The same with video samples. Kind of like a
           mini portfolio.
